        <h2 class="sub-title1">Overview</h2>
        <p>This project was created for a lower-division publishing course.</p>
        <p>For this project, I chose to feature a ceramic studio I happily discovered through Instagram called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tortus/?hl=en" target="_blank" class="intext-link">Tortus Copenhagen</a>. This brochure advertises the series of pottery workshops that are held at the Tortus Studio and taught by Eric Landon, the co-founder of of Tortus.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-title1">Process</h2>
        <h3 class="sub-title2">Research</h3>
        <p>Looking at Tortus’ Instagram and website, I wanted the colours and visuals in my brochure to reflect the humble simplicity of the pottery studio and the traditional yet modern city life in Copenhagen. I found the use of imagery to be a dominant tool in Tortus’ digital presence as a way of attracting followers and viewers by showcasing the different forms, textures, and colours of the ceramics.</p>

      </figure>

      <div class="project-analysis project_container">
        <h3 class="sub-title2">Design Decisions</h3>
        <p>I kept the overall design simple, clean, and minimalistic when arranging content and used imagery from the Tortus Studio to help with the visual flow of information. I used a taupe colour to mimic the pottery clay and muted earthy tones in the photography. The overlapping titles serve as a typographic decoration and I picked accent colours that were based on the different glazing of his vessels and glazes.</p>
        <p>To organize the content, I thought about how best to support the hierarchy of information and what would be the most important for the viewer to see when he or she first opens up the brochure. The exterior layout includes the important information that is pertinent to what the brochure is advertising — the dates of the workshop and the location of the studio. When the viewer opens the brochure, the interior layout will then give more detailed information about the workshops, as well as more about who would be teaching the workshops, Eric Landon, and where it would be held, the Tortus Studio.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-title1">Final Product</h2>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~jaquino/Ephemera_TortusBrochure.pdf" target="_blank" class="intext-link">brochure</a> is printed on 8.5" by 11" paper.</p>

      <div class="project-analysis project_container">
        <h2 class="sub-title1">Takeaway</h2>
        <p>I think that the project was successful in terms of the overall design that matches the Tortus’ simple aesthetic. For a first-year publication course, my professor praised my control of content, grid layout, and typographic styles.</p>

        <p>Creating this design got me thinking about the user experience of opening a brochure and taking in information. As I was playing with the layout of content, I thought about how a viewer might logically flow through the brochure and which information might work better in a certain place over another.</p>
